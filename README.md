# My First DevOps Project

This is my first DevOps project that demonstrates Docker, Linux commands, Git, and GitHub.

## 5 DevOps Concepts I Learned

### 1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Instead of manually setting up servers, we write code (Dockerfile) to define our infrastructure. This makes it repeatable and version-controlled.

### 2. Containerization
Docker containers package applications with all their dependencies, so they run the same way everywhere - on your laptop, in testing, or in production.

### 3. Version Control
Git helps track changes to our code. If we make a mistake, we can easily go back to a previous version.

### 4. Continuous Integration
We can automatically build and test our Docker image whenever we push changes to GitHub.

### 5. Collaboration
GitHub allows multiple people to work on the same project without interfering with each other's work.

## How I Completed This Assignment

### Step 1: Project Setup
I created a new directory for my project and set up Git with my personal information.

**Commands used:**
```bash
mkdir my-devops-project
cd my-devops-project
git config --global user.name "Sweta-504"
git config --global user.email "swetalinananda07@gmail.com"
